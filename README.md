# Global Converter

Gotta Convert 'Em All!

## Context

Welcome to the Global Converter project! This project is designed for beginner developers looking to enhance their skills in Java programming. The goal is to create an application capable of converting messages between different numeric bases (octal, hexadecimal, binary, decimal, and text), while also allowing encryption and decryption of these messages.

### Description

Global Converter is a Java application that translates character strings into different numeric bases. It verifies the validity of the input strings, ensures that only valid bases are used, and allows reverse conversion. Additionally, it includes a simple encryption algorithm (such as Caesar cipher) to encrypt and decrypt messages.

#### Features

- **Base Conversion**: Convert character strings to octal, hexadecimal, binary, decimal, or text bases.
- **Validation**: Ensure that input strings are valid and contain only alphanumeric characters.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt character strings using simple encryption algorithms.
- **Reverse Conversion**: Convert results back to their original base.
- **Conversion Options**: Support for abbreviated conversion options.

### How to use it?

1. User inputs a message.
2. The application validates the input.
3. The user selects a base for conversion.
4. The application converts the message to the selected base.
5. Optional: The user can encrypt or decrypt the message.
6. The application displays the result.
7. The user can reverse convert the message back to its original base.

### How to launch the application?
This project has two different versions:
1. The terminal version is launched from the Main.java file
2. The GUI version is launched from the GlobalConverterApplication.java file

Thank you for participating and happy coding!
